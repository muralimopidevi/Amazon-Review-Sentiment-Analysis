Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community.

I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.</td><td>06 25, 2012</td><td>A5A4374R8I7NB</td><td>PWB Esq</td><td>Works Fine, But It Died On ME</td><td>1340582400</td></tr><tr><td>6073894996</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>This charger works great and is short, unlike most chargers.

Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency. Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There's no way to verify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it's an original Samsung.

After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery. Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive. That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement.

This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.</td><td>02 4, 2005</td><td>A17BUUBOU0598B</td><td>Mark \"Technology, Music and Movies\"</td><td>A good unit at a great price.

Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the \"skip\" mode as following:\"One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a \"skip\" mode. When a tape player's \"skip\" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it \"hears\" sound again. If your tape player has a \"skip\" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in \"normal\" play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to \"fast forward\" over any silent portions of your audio feed.\"This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the \"skip\" mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again.

I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter.

The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly. Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter.In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality (without that white noise the tape players give off), adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75% volume and keep it there while plugged in.

The cord can be adjusted to travel from the adapter horizontally or vertically, which is great depending on your tape deck.The only negative I found was that after a few weeks of use, it stopped working properly. My car's tape deck is an auto-reverse deck, and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks, then shut down on me and stopped, but if you look at J Cristofferson's review, there are tons of comments on how to fix this. I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly. Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple.

It'll get stuck in this infinite loop. You have to take it out, smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in.

The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live.</td><td>07 4, 2004</td><td>APGPEJS55U2SF</td><td>Jeffrey Liss</td><td>Great Bluetooth Phone</td><td>1088899200</td></tr><tr><td>B0000AGRYX</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>2.0</td><td>the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20.

I heard upgrading the firmware resolves freezing issues, increases the quality/compression of the pictures, and overall makes the phone more useable... but I none of these things have affected me like others, so I haven't looked into how to upgrade it.

It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car.I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you.This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer.  (Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).

The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping). So, aside from Nokia compatibility, still no complaints.</td><td>04 27, 2011</td><td>A3H3SG8XIXVKXZ</td><td>Science Aardvark</td><td>non-identical twins</td><td>1303862400</td></tr><tr><td>B0000ALPBP</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded.

I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking \"talk me off speaker phone\", and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a \"soft phone\" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.  My experience is stictly in a home office environment.</td><td>03 26, 2013</td><td>A2PRIQ2EA5GYML</td><td>William M.

The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine.

Problems the phone has that I find to be a real problem: 1. The battery life is the worst of any phone I've ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up.I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere.

I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205. Furthermore, the games are actually java with E7154) The flash can also serve as a flashlight. Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright.5) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures. Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won't find bluetooth on this.Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time... it's always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really.

They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return.

The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.

I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710. I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since \"downgraded\" to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are \"Out of Service.\"Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone.

My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.  Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons.  The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall, I would recommend this phone.  The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I think that Motorola needs to darken the text on the buttons for those users who like to text message or who have vision problems.</td><td>04 24, 2004</td><td>ACHTDPEQYSEQL</td><td>mhnstr</td><td>Great Phone, Light Buttons</td><td>1082764800</td></tr><tr><td>B00013BL18</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I recently used two of the plug on a trip.

This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years. Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market. This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2.1A ports) as well as a standard power socket. Let's cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it's not Sabrent's fault. My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out. If you're in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price.

But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</td><td>09 17, 2013</td><td>A1E1LEVQ9VQNK</td><td>J.

I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable.  But, I knew there wasn't when I bought it.  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that.

The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.</td><td>03 8, 2010</td><td>AT0LAX5LUCP4X</td><td>B.

It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've \"pulled your ear back\" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).

Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but you'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline.

Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place.

But a cheap way to alleviate such a problem would be to cover the LED lights with tape.I used this device as a hub for all my USB devices for my MacBook Pro (2009) and the device works flawlessly, including for my USB speakers.</td><td>09 5, 2009</td><td>A313H6238N589</td><td>Jaewoo Kim \"OB-Wan\"</td><td>Becoming more of a neccessity.</td><td>1252108800</td></tr><tr><td>B000227PL8</td><td>List(5, 5)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I use this on my MacBook so I can connect several items at the same time including a USB keyboard and optical mouse, my iPad and iPhone, a webcam, an external hard drive and even a light o Rama controller for my Christmas lights.

This guy works great and I am not at all disappointed in performance. I am however a bit disappointed in the design. This has to sit on the corner of my desk and i need plenty of room on both sides to allow the USB cables to plug in.

I bought a 7-port CyberPower Hub from another vendor to use at work.  It's lasted with day in and day out use for about two years.  One heavy use is that I use a password manager on a USB thumbdrive and it gets plugged in at least twice a day.  The CyberPower hub at work doesn't seem to mind.The hubs at home, and even the USB ports on my motherboards, seem to loosen up and not keep a good grip on the USB thumbdrive.  So, when my home hub flaked out again, I decided to get a hub that I know works, and keeps on working, for use at home.The only drawback to the hub is the LED's on it.  They are a little too bright, and not really all that useful.  However, it's not a problem at work, and at home, the hub is hidden behind a monitor.

But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port \"in person,\" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to \"fatten up\" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest \"gripe\": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the \"cuteness\" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This \"off brand\" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington \"round mound\" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]</td><td>01 17, 2008</td><td>A6FIAB28IS79</td><td>Samuel Chell</td><td>4 years of flawless performance (I even bought another for my wife)--until now.</td><td>1200528000</td></tr><tr><td>B000227PL8</td><td>List(0, 2)</td><td>1.0</td><td>For one, this product is built very cheap.

Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to \"not work\" entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with.

For example, the memory card is under the battery. The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while. This is representative of the entire phone operation. Not for the impatient.If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't. Even the instruction booklet is out of order.APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open. No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications. On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac. Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor. I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches. I've had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.As for appearance, well, that's subjective. Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'. It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung. Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big. Solid, squeak-free, large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless. First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc. Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires. Still not sure? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well. This is no small deal. If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier. The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850). The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia. The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas. As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness. Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors. It films 10 second video, for crying out loud. The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.GAMES - Java. Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space. In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site. There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost. The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone. If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated. A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price. Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable. It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.</td><td>03 9, 2005</td><td>A14EF1PPKMSEPU</td><td>E.

I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied. This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!</td><td>03 19, 2005</td><td>A18MBO1U4DPY20</td><td>Harkanwar Anand</td><td>Everything A Phone Should Be..</td><td>1111190400</td></tr><tr><td>B00022NE6I</td><td>List(2, 4)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I have been waiting to finish my 1 year contract to get this phone. i did find some bad reviews about 6600. but let me tell you folks its a awesome phone.

The EarWave Boom is a good model that will satisfy 90% of people who need hands-free functionality for their cell phones.Jabra has gotten away from the full molded ear gels for this model.  I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels, but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around.  It's comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack. That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug. Calling this \"Universal\" is a little bit of an overstatement, but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by. Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine.  For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with \"Noise Cancelling.\"  It's about $7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm. For those who don't like the microphone arm, the Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt. Personally I don't like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models.  The differences are mainly in comfort, style, and ease of use.  This product is decently priced, but I think it could be more affordable.Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.  This is a pretty good model though, definitely enough to satisfy most users.</td><td>02 4, 2005</td><td>A17BUUBOU0598B</td><td>Mark \"Technology, Music and Movies\"</td><td>Good middle of the road earpiece from Jabra.

Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying \"headset signal weak - switch to handset?\"The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is \"connected\" (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant \"crackling\" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just \"disconnect\" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The \"hanging\" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.  Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.  I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes.  If you have small earlobes (rather than pendulous ones) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here.  I wish I had...</td><td>02 1, 2005</td><td>A1W5N8OT55A9Y3</td><td>B.

Two weeks later and I'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I'm sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery. I'd really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.Regardless, I have found the BT250 to be a better value than the HS810.</td><td>11 27, 2004</td><td>A3JMO0ET6611HV</td><td>M.D. \"mdoan300\"</td><td>Is this thing on?</td><td>1101513600</td></tr><tr><td>B000246XQE</td><td>List(19, 19)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I owned two versions of this unit. One with the Nokia 3650 (apparently the 3650 requires a specific type as compared to some of the other BT phones) and the second one that I currently own is with the Motorola V600.This comparison will cover both Jabra units and will compare them to the Nokia HDW-2 Blutooth adapter as well as the Motorola HS-820 bluetooth adapters.The jabra unit boasts a much better design. The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward. The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room. The reception was about the same for both (not use-able).

While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line.  On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker.  That's about it.  Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something.  I am trying the Motorola next.

I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.</td><td>04 1, 2006</td><td>A3IAAVB63OE76I</td><td>T.

I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed.

I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it.

There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a \"good\" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks. A decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice while standing between the exhausts of a 1500hp tank engine.</td><td>10 12, 2005</td><td>A377LPVLLAI42D</td><td>Chris</td><td>OK battery life, questionable sound quality</td><td>1129075200</td></tr><tr><td>B0002F7I94</td><td>List(10, 11)</td><td>2.0</td><td>This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever, I've been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well ----- however, the connection speeds take forever to establish ---- in addition, the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 --- I've heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary.....UPDATE: I have also tried the Moto 850 ---- sadly, it is really no better than the 810 --- there are some volume improvements, but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 ---- I recommend the Scala 500</td><td>01 11, 2005</td><td>A33FS5H3CPDR6D</td><td>Miguel Ali \"Film Director & Political Pundit\"</td><td>Volume is too low</td><td>1105401600</td></tr><tr><td>B0002F7I94</td><td>List(3, 4)</td><td>2.0</td><td>I have had this headset for several months now, and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life.

It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it.

They don't work very well, at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a \"universal\" device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit. The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words.</td><td>03 2, 2006</td><td>A680RUE1FDO8B</td><td>Jerry Saperstein</td><td>An excellent companion - - - far superior to IR keyboards.</td><td>1141257600</td></tr><tr><td>B0002OKCXE</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>Once you get a keyboard for your pda / smart phone, you won't go back.

Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us, these days, I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find, particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased, nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power, too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However, my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type, in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size, in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case, this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available, I think, only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems, but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called \"smart phones\" do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly, this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games, rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS, Android, and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard, if you are looking for a durable, reliable, and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.</td><td>04 11, 2011</td><td>A3VAROHXBXV0I2</td><td>M.

(meaning you are incorrect, on this keyboard)That said, entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard, just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it.

Nothing feels quite like that lol!This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men's pant pocket. I wear shorts, pants, etc. and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent.

I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class, and type in my lap. Sweet!Anyhow, is this thing essential? I mean, I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in, say, a statistics class with graphs and stuff...you can't draw graphs with this thing very well.

Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose, it may well be just what you want, despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part, but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk, not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips, two weeka later, in the same shape, ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site, I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10, now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270, a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop, and I was able to use it as a keyboard, without special drivers.  Probably, with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts, but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation, although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12, what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key, how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line, but if you then accidentally hit cntl, you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are, as I write this, available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs, Some Smartphones, and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future, specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great, and the PS3 does not use F1-F12, so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it, or type addresses if you are surfing, or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special, I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard, I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it, go to applications, start the keyboard application, go into bluetooth configuration, tell it to connect, dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list, and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works, and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done, so long as the palm does not need to be reset, the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes, the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused, it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key, it will resume communications immediately, without going through the menu. No, it is not a full sized keyboard, and there are some compromises, but it has a really good feel, even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard, the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded, and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop, be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard, a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple, easy to use, and works well. This is not a PC keyboard, and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard.

This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.  It should not only work well but hold up under normal use and parts should be made available and easy to find.-Feb. 21, 2006Update:  I contacted Think Outside Inc. through their website.  They sent me two replacement stands free of charge.  The customer service department was nice and I got the stands within three business days.  Great customer service!-Feb. 24, 2006Another Update:  I am still using the keyboard and it still works great and my replacement stand is holding up and I still have the extra they sent me.  I would purchase this again and I wish sellers like Dell knew to direct customers who experienced the problem I did to Think Outside for replacement parts.  They had excellent customer service unlike Dell (they wanted me to purchase another keyboard).-Sept. 15, 2006</td><td>02 21, 2006</td><td>ANF5BP1SD3Z3O</td><td>Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01</td><td>Works Great but the Stand is Fragile</td><td>1140480000</td></tr><tr><td>B0002OKCXE</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>4.0</td><td>Great ideal for a product, works perfectly and as advertised.

Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad, and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.</td><td>04 18, 2014</td><td>AVPNQUVZWMDSX</td><td>esanta \"esanta\"</td><td>Not bad, but stick to the original</td><td>1397779200</td></tr><tr><td>B0002SYC5O</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>3.0</td><td>I was hoping for a blue tooth that will connect to more than one phone.

No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad.

Recently, the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can't enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try.  Wow, I don't know what kind of power they use, I had three rides so far and I haven't experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up, no phone call conversation break up.  It's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time, I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn't hear me.

The party calls me back and this time, when I press the pickup button, the headset doesn't respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles, it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.

I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130.

The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250.

I find the headset very comfortable for extended periods of time. Price-wise, it was the cheapest headset from a reputable brand when I bought it. Battery life is decent, probably 3+ days, although I tend to charge it about every two days. Great for driving or any time you want your hands free but can't use speakerphone.Cons:People whom I call have complained occasionally about the sound quality. Range is not great, sometimes 10 ft causes annoying \"I am about to disconnect\" noise. Because there is only one main button that is used for everything, it is very easy to accidentally activate voice dialing, last-number redial, etc. Initial pairing with the phone was not intuitive at all: who knew you had to keep the button pressed while trying to pair up? Finally, the blinking blue light on you temple makes you look like a robot!Recommendation:This is an OK first/small/cheap BT headset. If you talk a lot on the phone, look for something else.

I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.

I sent it back and got a replacement from Motorola. However only a month or so after that, I seemed to have misplaced it, and had pretty much thought it was lost.Today, about a month and a half later, I found it, in my dryer. Apparently it had been in the pocket of one of my jeans that I hadn't washed for a while and it went through a whole wash and dry cycle. Happy that I found it, but I all but gave up on it to work again. I gave it a shot anyway, and lo and behold, it did start charging.

You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection (I did this using my Mac).Negative:The built-in email software is very poorly designed. It is sloooo[...] It requires way too many key clicks to accomplish common tasks. The most common email commands are buried in the menus, the least common commands occupy the prime spots. Someone didn't think about this enough. It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that's too much. They don't take advantage of the keyboard enough: The keyboard has a Delete key, but you can't use it to delete a message. That's a waste. Likewise, you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller, like in Outlook? To issue a command, you have to use the menu and arrow keys. They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses. (My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature)The case is pretty, but because it's perfectly symmetrical, you can't tell which end is up by feel alone. The keyboard is so slick that you can't dial by feel either -- you need to look. These are safety issues. (but if you have a headset, you can dial by voice)So far, the battery doesn't last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth, and who primarily talk or text, and who use POP3 occasionally, or not at all.</td><td>02 17, 2005</td><td>A1KE06KXZCYVWG</td><td>L.

Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to \"press 1 for English\", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter \"A\" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper, it isn't really ready for prime time.</td><td>02 26, 2005</td><td>A1L6CI04FBUA3J</td><td>Adrienne H.

You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.</td><td>10 6, 2004</td><td>A5JLAU2ARJ0BO</td><td>Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"</td><td>It's the service, stupid</td><td>1097020800</td></tr><tr><td>B00063DKVC</td><td>List(6, 9)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice.

I am a business user, not a Snoop Dog groupie, and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin, TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor, I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.  I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are \"OK\" but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger's website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates. Worth a year's contract with TMO in my book.  Paying $49/mo for 3000 regional anytime minuets and $20/mo for all you can eat data (email, text messaging, etc, etc EVERYTHING DATA included).I would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service.

They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, \"With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?\" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called \"screen\" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, \"[IMAGE]\", the button completely goes away, which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile's hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.</td><td>12 13, 2004</td><td>A1N03V52IRZ5PR</td><td>N.

I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 \"real\" pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few \"doodle type\" cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the \"hinge\" of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you, the old \"blue versions\" of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new \"black face\" ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led's near the \"flash\" when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don't.I like the phone and it's size is deceptive.

For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on, a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset, but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity, it goes to low-power mode \"sleep\". When the phone it is paired with rings, it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing, you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away, you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset, but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there.

This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to \"get off your crappy Jabra BT headset\" or \"take me off your Motorola BT headset\".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a \"correct\" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.

My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice!

Had I not needed Bluetooth to work with my new Toyota Prius, I'd have stuck with the i500. In fact, if Samsung/Sprint had released the i550 (SD memory slot, faster, etc.) I would have never considered the Treo 650.  So, let's talk about the positives of the 650:Camera w/movies is nice.  Memory card slot is nice.  It's fast. Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync! Handfree in the Prius works great. Having a PalmOS 5 based machine gives a more powerful web browser that can view more sites. Higher rez screen is nice.On the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it's as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on \"write on screen\" apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.No voice recognition at all, but for $20 you can get a program that is awesome and doesn't have to be trained.  \"Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2\" and it does.  \"Call Bob Tompson Mobile\" and it matches it to the address book -- no training, beyond numbers. VERY NICE.Battery life is so-so.  You have to charge it each day if you use the 'net much. i500 was poor, too, but better than this.  The 6035 I could use for almost a week without charging it!  (6035 and i500 had analog modes, too, while the 650 is digital only.)So, it's okay, I'm okay with it, it crashes/reboots randomly all the time, but ... there's really no other option on Sprint.I would have taken a flip phone over this huge brick phone in a heartbeat... But there is none, so, with that said, the Treo 650 is okay.  More steps back, a few steps forward, but no other choiuce.</td><td>08 27, 2005</td><td>A12EVK82QUTSA6</td><td>Allen C.

When a call comes in simply hit answer on the phone and the call comes through the headset. I don't particularly like the comfort fit of the Jabra on my ear so I will probably be looking at other alternatives as well.The camera is now actually good enough to take snapshots you would keep. Almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras.  A few of the critical buttons are placed more intuitively.Initial setup went pretty smoothly, so far, it seamlessly upgraded my old Treo 600 software and imported all my contacts and calendar as well as almost all my applications.  The Sprint phone rep that activated my phone actually seemed to be quite knowledgable.The only real CON is that the Treo 650 Hotsync cable connector is big and clunky compared to 600. IMHO they made a backward step by replacing the sleek original Treo connector with the Tungsten design connector. It requires a separate power supply to charge.  I have been used to charging my Treo 600 through the single USB hotsync cable to my laptop.  This extra power connection is a messy annoyance.  The upside is that since the battery is removable I can have a spare charging elsewhere.Overall opinion is that I wouldn't even consider returning to or buying a Treo 600 now that the Treo 650 is available.</td><td>11 26, 2004</td><td>A245BG7SCVXDJB</td><td>DaveT \"davet\"</td><td>A must get upgrade to the Treo 600!</td><td>1101427200</td></tr><tr><td>B0006FLA80</td><td>List(28, 29)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I am not too picky when it comes to a PDA phone, if I can keep my outlook calendar, appointment, and call the contact store on it, I'm happy! But I do wish the Treo 600 can be better!I had the Treo 600 for almost 1 year and upgraded to Treo 650 as soon as PalmOne asked me to that's because Parts of my prayer has been answered: A better screen resolution; touch screen is more sensitive than the 600, I use my finger instead of the stylus now; camera is a lot clearer and the zoom works great; removable battery is really handy to use that fully charged spare one any time; my favorite bluetooth is built-in. And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read. Thanks to the faster processor, the program loads a lot faster.However, I am still looking for the built-in WiFi, and the bluetooth does not take voice command; reboot is not as easy as Treo 600. I do not notice the boot up being slow because I rarely have to. However, I did notice that it takes up more internal memory and thus make the available ram less than 10MB the first time I turned it on. (Palm is doing a flash upgrade to fix this, so I heard.) With an SD card, I put a bunch of application on it to get around this until it get fixed. And I was able to have about 18MB available internally.I like this new Treo 650, as to all my handheld gadgets, I bought a fitted case to protect it. If you like me want to keep everything in perfectly nice looking condition, I recommad a case and a screen protector. Remember, this is a hefty investment comparable to a PC, this Treo 650 may even be your home phone, make sure it is well-protected.</td><td>12 21, 2004</td><td>AWHYWCU687LSJ</td><td>D.

At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a \"free return and repair,\" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?

I've always resisted buying a combined device, because I thought \"they aren't ready yet.\"  When it came time to replace my PDA, I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready.  I had concerns about the size of the screen, and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions.  Overall, most of my nervousness about it was groundless.  I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points:Works well as a phone--Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable, even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine.  The interface has been redesigned a bit, and you seldom need the stylus.  Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen, or with the keypad.  You truly can do many functions one-handed.  But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm, you aren't having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile--In English, this means that if your batteries go dead, you don't lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points:Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right.  It's not really a problem, but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms, I'm not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair.  I am able to get two days out of it with medium use, and have a bit of life left in the battery.  Not like the days of the monochrome Palms when you'd go for a week between recharges!It's only so-so as a web browser.The price is hideously high.Keyboard is cramped, but about as good as you can expect on such a small device.  It is definitely useable.  My instinct was to use my right thumb only, but I now believe the people who claim that if you use both hands (thumbs only) you'll be faster.From what I've seen of the Treo 600, I do not believe the upgrade would be worth it for those who currently own a 600.

If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.

The Scala 500 is incredibly lightweight and (when adjusted properly to your ear) very comfortable.I'm impressed by the controls.  Both the main button and the volume 'wheel' are very accessible and very responsive.  With the Sony HBH35 headset I was constantly dropping calls due to the unresponsive controls.  This never happens with the Scala 500.  Additionally, volume is easily regulated.Pairing with the Motorola MPX220 phone was quick and easy.  Additionally, reconnect is quick and reliable following a disconnect due to powering off one of the units or going out of range.  (Range, by the way, is good; comparable with the HBH35 headset.)You can hear the other party clearly and crisply.  Transmission of your voice, I would say, is good.  Though there's infrequent interferrence (static) on voice transmission, I've never had anyone complain about difficulty in hearing/understanding me.  There's NO annoying \"bluetooth echo.\"To sum it up:Plusses:  Price, size, weight, comfort, pairing, controls, sound quality, range, responsive customer service.Negatives:  Requires charging cradle (one more thing to haul around if you're traveling), no 'fuel guage' to indicate battery life (red flash comes on, but only when it's close to dying)</td><td>04 8, 2005</td><td>A2731AZYMXHG53</td><td>James R.

My only complaint really is that the tone of voices on my end sounds a bit like a tin can phone. Intelligibility is not a problem, but the sound is a bit disconcerting. Most people I talk to say it sounds fine on the other end, but one complained of the \"tunnel sound.\"But it is a good value. It synched with my T-Mobile Wing right away. I think it dropped a couple of calls, but cannot be certain where the blame lies. I just walked away from the phone and when I came back it reconnected immediately.Other comments: The eyeglasses clip is a great idea but I'll have to modify it to work with my thin wire frames. The ear clip is fine. The supplied neck cord is a good idea, but I'm not using it. The belt clip seems a bit vulnerable as it sticks out pretty far.Mine was missing the full manual (a return?), but the online PDF was easy to find.Overall, I did expect slightly better performance, but am satisfied with the value and general function of this headset.</td><td>08 30, 2007</td><td>AVFB9B931P1CJ</td><td>M.

The product integrates well with everything (My Laptop - sony vaio, cellphone (siemens sx56, my panasonic cordless home phone (although with the panasonic, ppl complain about my voice being faint)).  But the issue is , I hear static crackling noises even if I'm not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter, it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue, as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured, if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset, then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet , it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (1,2,3) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet, the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one, to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.  The manual says, that it is due to interference.  I think many 2.4 Ghz can cause this inteference.  Alhtough I turned off all of my wireles devices, it still caused the issue even in my car (slightly better, but not totally gone).But in any case if you don't hear the crackling, it integrates very well with everything.  The crackling is heard only by you, not by the person on the other side.  So we can probably live with it.  There are not many bluetooth adapters that are available out there.Note: Many reviewers here complain about this adpater not working well with home phones.  First of all, if you read the manual, this is not designed to work with home phones (if it works well with home phones, then you're lucky).

Given its low price, though, it's a great value, though I can see why some RAZR and PEBL boxes include this for *free*. My report card:Design: A-, nice simple design. Buttons are few and easy to use, though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A-, it's attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A, it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it's lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very \"floppy\" fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced \"speakerphone\" effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call.

It is hard to adjust the volume while in use.  Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust.  Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear.

The volume sits a little below half and I can hear perfectly in the car. Battery life rocks and voice clarity is a lot better than I remembered it with the first H500.4 out of 5 stars because the ear clip is flimsy and doesn't allow the H500 to sit tightly against your ear.

I do my research, ad nauseum, before getting into a new contract or into bed with a new cell provider. I've been a Nextel subscriber for two years with an i90 and an i730. Both lovely phones - service very professional from Nextel - coverage and features what I expected.  But like I said, I researched that to death before I bought their phones or their service.  Got the phones from Amazon.I, too, was taken by the looks of the RAZR, and so was my wife once she saw one.  But was it as good as it looked and was it worth and worth switching carriers for?  For one, Nextel wasn't making it easy to stay with them - they got into bed with Sprint and I had Sprint for years and still have nightmares about their customer service.  (Plus, the price for an \"upgrade phone\" for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view.  Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact!)I got two RAZR's at a local retailer - sorry Amazon, but your rebates with Cingular aren't worth the effort - and paid $99 each, best price *anywhere.*  I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon's and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel.  A *bunch* of money.  Two words: rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone, reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well, if not better, than my i730, which is a *great* phone, and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony, Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have.  I repeat: I read some of the manual, which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book, shame on you.  I was worried about the address book based on reviews, but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone, I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some.  There are so many ways to configure the address book it's silly.  You can assign and create \"categories\"  for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life, the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it, better than half the phones on the market today.  I can say that cos I feel like I've researched about half the phones on the market ... :)  Do this: plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night.  I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone? How clumsy are you?  I've beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it.  Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot, which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times.  I'm happy with the material and it's expected durability.  Stop throwing your delicate, *expensive,* micro-electronic device around like it's made of teflon.  *Be careful.*I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it's nature usually expensive and difficult.  (A good example is the ROKR, the so-called iTunes phone.  I have an iPod, and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod,I would have bought it, but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that isn't the easiest thing to pull off well ...) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink  of an eye.  It's expensive because it's a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious.  Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities, so don't be surprised by that.  Want a good camera phone for Cingular? The Sony s710 got great reveiws; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs.  That's the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it's not working out for me.  So there's a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone.  Still, I did my research so there wouldn't be too many surprises when I got the phone.Hope this helps.</td><td>09 16, 2005</td><td>A3AUR4JFEJNXDY</td><td>anthonyg</td><td>Lovely phone - get what you pay for... !</td><td>1126828800</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(10, 13)</td><td>3.0</td><td>The phone is ok. I didn't find any difference between RAZR and the Motorolla V300 I had earlier. All the features are the same.Razr has a big huge color screen, bluetooth enabled and can capture videos.

Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the \"MORE\" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the \"audio sweet spot\" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? \"Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.\"4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says \"Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet\". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.</td><td>08 27, 2005</td><td>A39KJOCZGCM8P1</td><td>Chris Lee Mullins</td><td>Great looking phone....if yer into that sort of thing</td><td>1125100800</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(26, 27)</td><td>3.0</td><td>The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.

I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.

Way way too unwieldy. They need to update this error big time. They've also missed on priority numbers - you know, you identify people you call a lot, and they go to the head of the list.

I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me.  Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away.  The best phone I ever had.  Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos.  Really big disapointment.  Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia.  When this came out I jumped on it.  Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones.PROS:-Some what sturdy case.  The metal parts seem solid. No marks as of yet (1 month).-The battery life is a little tiny bit higher then your average phone.  I have to charge it at night but it has at least half the life left on it.  I talk for about 3 hours a day.-Camera is ok not the best and by far not the worst.-Slim form factor.  And yes its wider then your normal flip but this is a good size.  Other phones always seemed to skinny for me.CONS:-Not all of it is metal.  The bottom is plastic and it seems to be cheap plastic.  It creaks when you push on it.  I think that is where the antenna is, and if it has a SAR rating of .80 (I think) at the ear then I wonder how much your jaw is getting.  Rather my jaw get cancer then my brain right?-The vol is almost a joke it is so low.  At the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting.  I used to have to turn people down on my cell, now I am struggling to hear them sometimes.-The keypad looks nice but its a pain in the butt.  The donut thing in the middle is already scracthed by my finger nail.  The rest of the keypad is protected it seems and has no marks.-A pain to clean.  The keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it.  When you clean it the rubber lining between the keys grabs part of what ever cloth you are using and gets it looking even worse.-Phone book.  Good god man.  The fact that they used this phone book really shows that either they don't put a lot of effort into the phone or was a total mess up.  Either way it is a true shame.-Good luck with support and warranty from Moto.  Past experiences with them was very poor.  You send your phone to get fixed and a month later you get it back and they didn't even read what the problem was before they \"fix\" it and send it back still broken.The reason they make phones out of cheap plastic in my opinion is because what do you do 6 months after your phone looks like you dropped it down the stairs a few dozen times.  You buy another.  Strong durable plastic is used all the time.  For crying out loud Glad uses it all the time.  I am more then happy to pay 600 dollars on quality and if you have the money do the same.  This phone is not even close to meeting my expectations of what I thought I would get for a 600 dollar \"basic\" cell phone.  I have high standards and for top dollar I want the best.  Moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now. 250 or something on Amazon as of now.  Well worth it for that price.To the other reviewer about Verizon.  They use CDMA and this phone is only for GSM.  I doubt they will ever make a CDMA version.  But of course I have no real clue.  Call Motorola.Also sorry for my spelling mistakes and all.  It would take to much time to go back and review what I wrote.  I am not getting paid for this and won't waste my time.

CHECK. Innovative construction... CHECK. Exclusive price tag... CHECK. In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike, the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such. If you're looking for a feature rich phone, then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less. But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams, &#34;look at me, I'm a sexy b*tch,&#34; then the V3 is up your alley.Actually, a better analogy would be: The Acura NSX of mobile phones. Like the NSX, I feel the V3 is a marketing tool for Motorola. It's their way of saying, &#34;We're known for inexpensive phones, but, look, we can build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;Unless wireless technology improves from GSM, the V3 is a phone that I can definitely keep for more than 2 years. The styling, design, and construction is just that good (I upgraded from a trusty and reliable, yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone).There's been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I've heard is that the bottom backside (below the battery cover) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna. It certainly makes perfect sense to me (unless the metal frame IS the antenna) as all the other areas are cold to touch (in this weather) while those areas are usually room temperature. Furthermore, it would be misrepresentation on Motorola's part to advertise it as such. Regardless, this phone may seem flimsy, but it's very solid -- there is no comparison w/ my old Nokia 3360 and my girlfriend's V551.Mikey's likeys:1- The mini-USB port. This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it's simple and should be a mobile phone standard!2- The Bluetooth connectivity. Coming from a wired hands-free setup, my Bluetooth headset (a Jabra BT250) is a godsend. I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room. (SIDE NOTE: stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details)3- Quad band. Doubtful that I'll ever use this feature/benefit, but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone. I've been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones, but I've got to admit, the V3's speaker phone is the bomb. It's loud and clear (but not loud enough for the car). My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup. When I don't have my Bluetooth headset, I'm spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display. Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks, I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display. And not only that, the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator! All other phones (excluding PDA phones) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey's no-likeys:1- No memory expansion. I don't see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory, but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice. Maybe Motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner's manual. I have found that the owner's manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own. It does not explain how to use many common features that owners (especially ones new to Motorola phones) use. Instead, it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together. It's like the &#34;C++ Reference&#34; vs &#34;Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days.&#34; Maybe Motorola's technical writers are just to technical?3- Drops and dings. Like any &#34;Ferrari,&#34; I'll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone. I'm hoping there will be [good] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket. (SIDE NOTE: I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone, but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance)4- No EDGE. My girlfriend's $99 Motorola v551 has EDGE. Shame, shame, shame Motorola. Bad Motorola. Bad, bad, bad. Alas, it's akin to buying a $160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k for an Acura NSX and it's only 290hp).5- Internal display colors. I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors, but Motorola's specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors, but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback. Very, very, sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone. PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers (you don't have to do this if a name only has one number);2- set the address book view to &#34;Primary Contacts&#34; in Phonebook Menu &#62;&#62;&#62; Phonebook Setup &#62;&#62;&#62; View;3- voila, only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia's implementation (refer to my owner's manual dis-like above), but I have found Motorola's implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE: It's been nearly three weeks since I've bought this phone and no buyer's remorse.</td><td>11 21, 2004</td><td>A3JMO0ET6611HV</td><td>M.D. \"mdoan300\"</td><td>The Ferrari of Mobile Phones</td><td>1100995200</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've had this phone for a while now and here's what I think.The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people, and yes, it's not as intuitive as say, Nokia's interface, but it does have some pros.  You can customize every button, including all 4 arrows, and the left and right soft keys.  I have my left soft key programmed to go to \"Shortcuts\" and I have every function I need right there.  And of course, after a while of use, you will get used to the interface.The volume of the phone is decent.  I have no problems hearing other people, and they have no problems hearing me.  Speakerphone works great too.  My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he's talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls.  The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring.  One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this:  If you use your SIM card to store your addresses, then no, you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person.  But if you use your phone's memory to store your numbers, you can have many many numbers stored to each entry.  I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook's address book, so I'm not too worried about having them on my SIM card.  And if you have a MAC, iSync works wonders with syncing numbers/calendars to the RAZR....now THAT'S cool!The screen is very large and clear.  I have no problems seeing it in dark or even bright light.  I have had no problems with reception with Cingular so far.  In fact, I have a stronger signal in most places than my previous phone (Nokia 6230)Overall, I am very pleased with the design, functions, and asthetics of this phone.</td><td>11 16, 2005</td><td>AYW1TGDCP2OK6</td><td>MestaySS</td><td>So far, so great!</td><td>1132099200</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(3, 5)</td><td>3.0</td><td>Bought this phone(Actually the black v3 but the only real difference is video support and additional memory), for $149 from BB, replacing my v551, basically just for the \"chic factor\". Initally I was very happy and excited with my purchase, but after a couple of weeks the novelty wore off and its shortcomings became apparent. The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece. Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random \"sweet spot' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments. I even removed the little \"M\" circle with little or no help. The second shortcoming is the the screen. While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good. And if you are viewing blacks and not looking directly at it, you get a wierd grey-black thing going on with one eye. Kind of hard to explain, except for those of you with the phone. Much to my dismay the screen is actually WORSE than the one on the v551. The third is the camera. I rarely use a phone cam, but the times I needed it, the pictures looked, well...horrible. And last but not least, the reception. The reception is not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The v551 actually had better reception. My new LG CE500 actually has MUCH better reception and is generally a much better phone. This phone is a GOOD phone.

Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a \"shared plan\" from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your \"Cell phone Numbers\" right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a \"single 700 rollover mins shared plan\" before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to \"My Account\" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular \"in my area\" puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away \"With NO ROAMING charges\" btw our last cell phone service \"Alltel\" would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in \"Speaker Phone\" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call \"Mobile to Mobile\".We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it \"needs\" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the \"address book being slow\" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don't, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by \"Name\" or \"Speed dial #\" or \"Voice name\" or even by \"Email\" and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for \"Voice command\" it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for \"list only\" \"no picture\" and by \"primary number only\", simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in \"Categories\" such as \"Business/Personal/General/VIPs\"Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have \"primary number only\" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to \"Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers\" once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about \"ear piece volume too low\"  the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the \"volume\" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the \"top edge of the phone\", too low and volume will sound low. Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose \"PHONE\" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under \"sunlight\" is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE: 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones, neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use (these are our only phones, we only have cell phone service no land line).The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them.</td><td>10 7, 2005</td><td>AVK9BSXJJ51I8</td><td>S.

The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively.  My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement.  It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner.  I was concerned about the thickness and durability.  This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone.My old accessories don't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do?I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3.0 by Avanquest for my previous phone.  I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4.0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone.  With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I don't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip.  I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone's memory and I use it as my wallpaper.My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola.  On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning.  I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying.The Razr and my Jabra work well together.  It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes.So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone.</td><td>10 30, 2006</td><td>ANF5BP1SD3Z3O</td><td>Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01</td><td>Razr V3 works great for me.</td><td>1162166400</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2G3U</td><td>List(9, 11)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I had a Samsung X427 before this and it was awful.

I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can't believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3's to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don't waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks.</td><td>09 5, 2005</td><td>A35IX2GE0VC0JP</td><td>FirePepper Red \"firepepper red\"</td><td>Excellent Phone</td><td>1125878400</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2G3U</td><td>List(17, 18)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've had this phone for about four months now, and I haven't had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces.  I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone.</td><td>04 26, 2005</td><td>A2ZZGWC4FUGJAE</td><td>M.

There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling.

This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it.  Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum).  From the many online reviews I've read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls.  I haven't seen many of those types of comments lately so I'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros--Very good reception and sound quality.  Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It's nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly).  Nice raised number keys.--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ringtones; also extensive selection of built in ringtones (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals).--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn't with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn't actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it's fine.  You can store five numbers and an email per entry. (You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing).  It's not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works.--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto's recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it's fine.  Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use.  (As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically.)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60.  But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds.  You have to touch a key to make it come back on.  This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user's manual doesn't explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that's the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky.  As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds).--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user's manual--Lousy user's manual--Did I mention the lousy user's manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal.  In other words, it \"learns\" one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase.--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off: I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC)--I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal.--The synchronization software (Motorola Mobile Phone Tools)and cable cost extra.  I have not been able to make it function.  Motorola's support is utterly worthless--I asked for help online and they told me to call them.  Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person.  The software developer--BVRP--is trying to help but hasn't been able to fix the problem.  I may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software.</td><td>05 27, 2005</td><td>A3LSLLR3OAJI7Y</td><td>Steven Metz</td><td>I'm Very Pleased</td><td>1117152000</td></tr><tr><td>B0006J419Q</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I didn't like it but my husband seems to think that it works great for him and uses it often.</td><td>01 8, 2013</td><td>A38X2R3BOQGQZQ</td><td>B.

The buds are hard plastic in-the-ear type with a thin cushion (which you must install without tearing). The microphone is on the left bud, and is held close to your mouth because the left side wire is much shorter than the right side. The mic has an answer/hang up button.

The buds have bass ports and the mic capsule is a reasonable size. The Centro has a microSD card for storing MP3 tracks, and this headset does a good job reproducing the dynamic range of classical music.There are better headsets available.

Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don't understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won't have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it, it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn't take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter, but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere.</td><td>04 9, 2006</td><td>A35IX2GE0VC0JP</td><td>FirePepper Red \"firepepper red\"</td><td>Good  headset but has its flaws</td><td>1144540800</td></tr><tr><td>B0007IOMOU</td><td>List(6, 6)</td><td>4.0</td><td>The battery life on this unit is great. I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks. (It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.)I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good.The sound is OK. It's not the best. If it's noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it's sometimes hard to hear.It'll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that's really your first clue about the battery.The earpiece is OK; it's not as secure as I'd hope. If you're outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it.Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they're always having to charge them.

Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces.

I decided to use the BoxWave exclusively and have not been dissatisified with my decision.  I simply slide the Note 2 into my front pocket.  And no, the phone isn't too big for my pants pocket.The pros for this case is that it makes the Note 2 look stylish, and due to the rubbery feel, it makes the phone feel quite stable in my hand; however, the rubbery feel doesn't interfere with it going in and out of my pocket.  If I had to come up with a con for the BoxWave Tuxedo Suitup case, it would be that due to its glossiness, it shows fingerprints,  However, they wipe off easily.In summary, I would definitely order one of these cases again.</td><td>01 2, 2013</td><td>A1KXM1DAQUE89H</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Great case</td><td>1357084800</td></tr><tr><td>B0007MAOOS</td><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I received this item in Dec.

I can't remember the name but as soon as I do I will update this review so you can order this case and holster combo just for the holster.

There's a huge difference, in case you, the reader, doesn't know.  TPU is better... LIGHT YEARS better!But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there; and not because there's anything wrong with the TPU. Rather, it's because they're cheaply made, or not cut precisely accurately... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut.  It's perfect.  Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath... the camera lens, the flash, the speaker, the mic holes, the earphone jack, and, of course, the stylus.  Note that there's no holes for the power button or volume rocker......and that, TRUST ME, is the way it SHOULD be!  So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers, and that's a huge mistake.  If you've ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know, the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you've ever open one of those up and cleaned one, then you've seen the dark kinda' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot.  That stuff is body oil, mixed with skin cells, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with lint from the mouse pad, mixed with godknows what else.  It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch......including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone!  And when that stuff gets in there, buttons stick, and phones either won't turn on or off, or can't have their screens awakened properly... or, one of the common ones which people often don't realize is caused by a sticking power button:  boot loops!Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem.  Of course, there's still the electromechanical HOME key that's uncovered; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken, because their HOME keys cause weird behavior; but, in fact, all that's wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with... well... you get the picture.There's not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem (if it's a hardware electromechanical one, as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass), but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them......and this one does... and magnificently.  It even has nicely-molded buttons (as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it.  This case is simply molded beautifully!This case is special for another reason, too, which many people, I'll bet, don't know about, and that's precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone: the bezel around the glass screen.  It's really nice, and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda' unique in that the very, very edges of its glass screen  aren't like almost any other phone.  Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens; and then there's the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass's edge all-'round; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen, so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table, the glass, itself, it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table's surface.Well, the Note II's glass is actually higher up (when it's lying on its back) than the bezel edge of the case; and, in fact, the very, very edge of the Note II's glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case's bezel. As such, if you lay the Note II on its face (on its glass, it's the glass that actually touches the table.  This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors; and one maker of them (REALOOK) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II: one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II's screen, and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge; and then they make another (the REALOOK \"3D\" screen protector for the Note II) that's molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and \"hang\" down over it, so to speak, to make the protector's edge come closer to the case's bezel, and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases, the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel, that's fine.  The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass.  But with the  REALOOK \"3D\" style screen protector that wraps over the edge, that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass, so that if the phone is laid on its face (on its glass sreen), the glass doesn't touch because it's being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk.  But it gets better:  That edge \"respects\" the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and doesn't try to wrap up over onto and cover it.  Therefore, the REALOOK 3D screen protector's edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case... different from most others... and the only kind you can have, actually, if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to, or over the edge of, the Note II's glass.Seriously, this thing is PRECISION... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II... and got it PERFECT!The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it wouldn't show such fingerprints.  The TPU cases out there that are called \"s-style\" or \"s-series\" TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the \"s\" shape on the case's back, and a shiny finish (like this case has everywhere) on the other side of the \"s\" shape on the case's back.  The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that's on those \"s\" cases, in my opinion; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly, those \"s\" series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass, and on the Note II, that doesn't work well with most screen protectors. Plus, many of those \"s\" style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons. Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp; and so for me, at least, it's worth it to just endure its shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.Great case!  Best-of-breed, at least among cases that don't cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up.  If one is not using a \"3D\" type of screen protector from REALOOK, though; if one is using REALOOK's other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II's screen, then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine (as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons); but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one. Seriously, this one is made very, very well... very precise. I just love it!Gregg L.

This doesn't have cutouts for the buttons, instead it has well-designed buttons of its own molded into the case that push on the phone's buttons.

I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.</td><td>06 25, 2012</td><td>A5A4374R8I7NB</td><td>PWB Esq</td><td>Works Fine, But It Died On ME</td><td>1340582400</td></tr><tr><td>6073894996</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>This charger works great and is short, unlike most chargers.

Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency. Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There's no way to verify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it's an original Samsung.

I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing, so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate.Like many other &#34;power users&#34; (i.e. slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5's internal battery. After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery. Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive. That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement. After two months of use, I can make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger.

This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.</td><td>02 4, 2005</td><td>A17BUUBOU0598B</td><td>Mark \"Technology, Music and Movies\"</td><td>A good unit at a great price.

I might have been able to tolerate that. However, there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine. The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player. The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok.

Until lately, my car tape player kept rejecting it out. I thought it was broken and I was about to buy this same product from Amaonz again. While reading some other people's reviews, I bump into R. Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the \"skip\" mode as following:\"One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a \"skip\" mode. When a tape player's \"skip\" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it \"hears\" sound again. If your tape player has a \"skip\" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in \"normal\" play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to \"fast forward\" over any silent portions of your audio feed.\"This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the \"skip\" mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again.

This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter.

The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly. Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter.In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality (without that white noise the tape players give off), adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75% volume and keep it there while plugged in.

My car's tape deck is an auto-reverse deck, and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks, then shut down on me and stopped, but if you look at J Cristofferson's review, there are tons of comments on how to fix this. I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly. Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple.

Will definitely buy another S-E phone again in the future.  I still don't like T-Mobile's coverage and especially service support, but this phone is a star.  Some may find teh buttons a bit too small, but they are well-spaced so fine for my large hands.

The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live.</td><td>07 4, 2004</td><td>APGPEJS55U2SF</td><td>Jeffrey Liss</td><td>Great Bluetooth Phone</td><td>1088899200</td></tr><tr><td>B0000AGRYX</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>2.0</td><td>the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20.

(Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).

The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping). So, aside from Nokia compatibility, still no complaints.</td><td>04 27, 2011</td><td>A3H3SG8XIXVKXZ</td><td>Science Aardvark</td><td>non-identical twins</td><td>1303862400</td></tr><tr><td>B0000ALPBP</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded.

I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day.I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for. This device solved both problems.  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control.  It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call.  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch.I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease.  The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit.  Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me.  Not with this unit.  The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty.  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy.

I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking \"talk me off speaker phone\", and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a \"soft phone\" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.

The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine.

It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up.I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere.

I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205.

Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright.5) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures. Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won't find bluetooth on this.Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time... it's always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really.

The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.

I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710. I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since \"downgraded\" to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are \"Out of Service.\"Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone.

(another story altogether) However, my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use.2) Familiar problem - phone's earpiece is too quiet.3) Software's pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive, it would save phone numbers under different people's names! No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings.

From the deal I'm seeing on here, i wish i could have just canceled and got a new account, but thats too much effort.... anywho, my choices boiled down to getting the E105 or this v300.  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS.She was wrong!  Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!  I'm going to have to upgrade my plan to allow more internet usage! There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO.Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two (meaning signal strength).  Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this.  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same.  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105.  If you want more from a phone than just making calls, get the v300 (or higher).</td><td>09 15, 2004</td><td>A1H4IVXNXWWBLV</td><td>Chilehead Photography \"Captured Moments are t...</td><td>Nice change from a Samsung S105</td><td>1095206400</td></tr><tr><td>B0000WZWSI</td><td>List(3, 3)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I've been using this phone for a few months now and have had a chance to use most of the features.  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone.  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways.-Decent battery life.  Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.

I changed phones and service because my old phone could not get reception inside of buildings.  I chose the V300 due to the external antennae.  I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased.  The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text.  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose.  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it.  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method.  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.  Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons.  The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall, I would recommend this phone.  The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I think that Motorola needs to darken the text on the buttons for those users who like to text message or who have vision problems.</td><td>04 24, 2004</td><td>ACHTDPEQYSEQL</td><td>mhnstr</td><td>Great Phone, Light Buttons</td><td>1082764800</td></tr><tr><td>B00013BL18</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I recently used two of the plug on a trip.

This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years. Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market. This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2.1A ports) as well as a standard power socket. Let's cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it's not Sabrent's fault. My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out. If you're in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price.

But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</td><td>09 17, 2013</td><td>A1E1LEVQ9VQNK</td><td>J.

I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable.  But, I knew there wasn't when I bought it.

The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.</td><td>03 8, 2010</td><td>AT0LAX5LUCP4X</td><td>B.

It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've \"pulled your ear back\" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.

But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port \"in person,\" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to \"fatten up\" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest \"gripe\": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the \"cuteness\" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This \"off brand\" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington \"round mound\" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]</td><td>01 17, 2008</td><td>A6FIAB28IS79</td><td>Samuel Chell</td><td>4 years of flawless performance (I even bought another for my wife)--until now.</td><td>1200528000</td></tr><tr><td>B000227PL8</td><td>List(0, 2)</td><td>1.0</td><td>For one, this product is built very cheap.

No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications. On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac. Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor. I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches. I've had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.As for appearance, well, that's subjective. Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'. It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung. Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big. Solid, squeak-free, large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless. First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc. Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires. Still not sure? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well. This is no small deal. If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier. The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850). The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia. The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas. As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness. Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors. It films 10 second video, for crying out loud. The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.GAMES - Java. Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space. In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site. There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost. The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone. If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated. A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price. Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable. It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.</td><td>03 9, 2005</td><td>A14EF1PPKMSEPU</td><td>E.

I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied. This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!</td><td>03 19, 2005</td><td>A18MBO1U4DPY20</td><td>Harkanwar Anand</td><td>Everything A Phone Should Be..</td><td>1111190400</td></tr><tr><td>B00022NE6I</td><td>List(2, 4)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I have been waiting to finish my 1 year contract to get this phone. i did find some bad reviews about 6600. but let me tell you folks its a awesome phone.

The EarWave Boom is a good model that will satisfy 90% of people who need hands-free functionality for their cell phones.Jabra has gotten away from the full molded ear gels for this model.  I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels, but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around.  It's comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack. That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug. Calling this \"Universal\" is a little bit of an overstatement, but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by. Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine.  For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with \"Noise Cancelling.\"  It's about $7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm. For those who don't like the microphone arm, the Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt. Personally I don't like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models.  The differences are mainly in comfort, style, and ease of use.  This product is decently priced, but I think it could be more affordable.Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.  This is a pretty good model though, definitely enough to satisfy most users.</td><td>02 4, 2005</td><td>A17BUUBOU0598B</td><td>Mark \"Technology, Music and Movies\"</td><td>Good middle of the road earpiece from Jabra.

Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying \"headset signal weak - switch to handset?\"The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is \"connected\" (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant \"crackling\" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just \"disconnect\" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The \"hanging\" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.  Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.  I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes.  If you have small earlobes (rather than pendulous ones) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here.  I wish I had...</td><td>02 1, 2005</td><td>A1W5N8OT55A9Y3</td><td>B.

The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery.

The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward. The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room.

You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line.

I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.</td><td>04 1, 2006</td><td>A3IAAVB63OE76I</td><td>T.

I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I'm not sure I'd actually keep it on my belt.

There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a \"good\" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks.

But after installing it on my current device (Verizon XV6800 running Windows Mobile 6.1), I decided I liked it too much to sell. I forgot how much I liked this keyboard. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1. The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain. I would have preferred another row of keys. It wouldn't have added that much size or weight.2. When the keyboard is open, it's supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings. If you are a slow typist, this is fine. But I'm a fast typist and I tend to hit the the keys pretty hard so the keyboard tips from side to side when I type. Really irritating. I fixed this by making two little supports from stacked cardboard glued together. I stick these under the \"wings\" and that solves the problem.Here's where I got the latest driver released for the device (it's no longer supported by iGO):[...]This driver is for Windows Mobile 5, but it works on my Mobile 6.1 device. :)You MUST install the driver in MAIN MEMORY - not a storage card. If you install it on a storage card, it won't work.After I installed the driver, the configuration utility suggested that I upgrade the keyboard's firmware. I thought this wouldn't work since the keyboard is no longer supported by iGO, but to my surprise, it did - my firmware was updated from 1.1 to 1.2.The previous reviewer said he had to use the pointing stick to send email.

It's great for writing a longer e-mail, inputting contacts, or writing a letter in word, when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it. I previously gave it one star, but now that it's acclimated and working I give it 4 only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been a full 5.

They don't work very well, at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a \"universal\" device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit. The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words.</td><td>03 2, 2006</td><td>A680RUE1FDO8B</td><td>Jerry Saperstein</td><td>An excellent companion - - - far superior to IR keyboards.</td><td>1141257600</td></tr><tr><td>B0002OKCXE</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>Once you get a keyboard for your pda / smart phone, you won't go back.

Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us, these days, I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find, particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased, nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power, too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However, my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type, in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size, in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case, this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available, I think, only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems, but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called \"smart phones\" do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly, this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games, rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS, Android, and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard, if you are looking for a durable, reliable, and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.</td><td>04 11, 2011</td><td>A3VAROHXBXV0I2</td><td>M.

This keyboard is all class: just like a laptop keyboard, with the same spring to the keys, quality, durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to'able, however symbols such as () and & or % can be a major pain, due to the fact that a) you have to use \"custom\" key commands using ctrl, fn1 and fn2 buttons and b) if you are an experienced typer, you \"already know\" the \"motion\" for & or * or (), and you'll find yourself doing them! (meaning you are incorrect, on this keyboard)That said, entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard, just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it.

Nothing feels quite like that lol!This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men's pant pocket. I wear shorts, pants, etc. and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent.

I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class, and type in my lap. Sweet!Anyhow, is this thing essential? I mean, I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in, say, a statistics class with graphs and stuff...you can't draw graphs with this thing very well.

Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose, it may well be just what you want, despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part, but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk, not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips, two weeka later, in the same shape, ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site, I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10, now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270, a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop, and I was able to use it as a keyboard, without special drivers.  Probably, with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts, but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation, although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12, what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key, how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line, but if you then accidentally hit cntl, you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are, as I write this, available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs, Some Smartphones, and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future, specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great, and the PS3 does not use F1-F12, so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it, or type addresses if you are surfing, or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special, I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard, I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it, go to applications, start the keyboard application, go into bluetooth configuration, tell it to connect, dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list, and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works, and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done, so long as the palm does not need to be reset, the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes, the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused, it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key, it will resume communications immediately, without going through the menu. No, it is not a full sized keyboard, and there are some compromises, but it has a really good feel, even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard, the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded, and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop, be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard, a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple, easy to use, and works well. This is not a PC keyboard, and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard. For what it is sold for, it is best of breed.</td><td>01 31, 2008</td><td>A1N03V52IRZ5PR</td><td>N. J.

It folds out to a full size keyboard, when opened the keyboard latches so it won't fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a \"techie\" by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside, Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.

Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad, and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.</td><td>04 18, 2014</td><td>AVPNQUVZWMDSX</td><td>esanta \"esanta\"</td><td>Not bad, but stick to the original</td><td>1397779200</td></tr><tr><td>B0002SYC5O</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>3.0</td><td>I was hoping for a blue tooth that will connect to more than one phone.

No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run.

HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad.

My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).

I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130.

This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250.

So try as I might, I cannot wear it for prolonged periods of time. After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging.

The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy, long-term usage.  It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog.  I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.

You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection (I did this using my Mac).Negative:The built-in email software is very poorly designed. It is sloooo[...] It requires way too many key clicks to accomplish common tasks. The most common email commands are buried in the menus, the least common commands occupy the prime spots. Someone didn't think about this enough. It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that's too much. They don't take advantage of the keyboard enough: The keyboard has a Delete key, but you can't use it to delete a message. That's a waste. Likewise, you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller, like in Outlook? To issue a command, you have to use the menu and arrow keys. They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses. (My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature)The case is pretty, but because it's perfectly symmetrical, you can't tell which end is up by feel alone. The keyboard is so slick that you can't dial by feel either -- you need to look. These are safety issues. (but if you have a headset, you can dial by voice)So far, the battery doesn't last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth, and who primarily talk or text, and who use POP3 occasionally, or not at all.</td><td>02 17, 2005</td><td>A1KE06KXZCYVWG</td><td>L.

Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to \"press 1 for English\", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter \"A\" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper, it isn't really ready for prime time.</td><td>02 26, 2005</td><td>A1L6CI04FBUA3J</td><td>Adrienne H.

You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.</td><td>10 6, 2004</td><td>A5JLAU2ARJ0BO</td><td>Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"</td><td>It's the service, stupid</td><td>1097020800</td></tr><tr><td>B00063DKVC</td><td>List(6, 9)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice.

I am a business user, not a Snoop Dog groupie, and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin, TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor, I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.  I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are \"OK\" but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger's website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates. Worth a year's contract with TMO in my book.  Paying $49/mo for 3000 regional anytime minuets and $20/mo for all you can eat data (email, text messaging, etc, etc EVERYTHING DATA included).I would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service.

They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, \"With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?\" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called \"screen\" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, \"[IMAGE]\", the button completely goes away, which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile's hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.</td><td>12 13, 2004</td><td>A1N03V52IRZ5PR</td><td>N.

I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 \"real\" pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few \"doodle type\" cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the \"hinge\" of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you, the old \"blue versions\" of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new \"black face\" ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led's near the \"flash\" when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don't.I like the phone and it's size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said, \"that thing is huge!\"..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.

For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on, a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset, but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity, it goes to low-power mode \"sleep\". When the phone it is paired with rings, it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing, you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away, you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset, but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there.

This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to \"get off your crappy Jabra BT headset\" or \"take me off your Motorola BT headset\".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a \"correct\" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.

I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N  headset - which I love for it professional wireless function.  I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time.  That was good enough for me.  Definitely worth the $ if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the house/office while talking on the phone.</td><td>07 27, 2006</td><td>A25WJCAP606YMP</td><td>ESVK \"SVK\"</td><td>Does what it says it will do...</td><td>1153958400</td></tr><tr><td>B0006B088W</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>3.0</td><td>There isn't much to say here.

You need to be certain it will work properly before you use the sticky tape to mount it in place.  So, you wind up holding it with one hand while working your headset to activate/deactivate it several times to be sure you've found the right spot for it.Comes with a special headset adapter for phones with shapes that offset the lifter bar.</td><td>10 24, 2013</td><td>AWIF8NC5PXKPW</td><td>Jack Smith</td><td>Does what it is meant to do.</td><td>1382572800</td></tr><tr><td>B0006B088W</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I used this phone lifter in combination with the Plantronics CS50 Wireless Office Headset.

This lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset.  You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing.  The setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone.I spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day.

Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me, plus a week's wait. I put all this stuff in the review, because I'm not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We're pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it's not the swiftest design imaginable. The little extender rod/gripper that is your last-ditch method to get your receiver to hang up is a kludge, in my opinion.

If the USB cable is unplugged, but the earpiece is left clipped into the holder/charger, the battery runs down within hours. Obviously a simple diode somewhere would have prevented this, but for me the device now is close to useless.Update: May 8th 2011.

Had I not needed Bluetooth to work with my new Toyota Prius, I'd have stuck with the i500. In fact, if Samsung/Sprint had released the i550 (SD memory slot, faster, etc.) I would have never considered the Treo 650.  So, let's talk about the positives of the 650:Camera w/movies is nice.  Memory card slot is nice.  It's fast. Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync! Handfree in the Prius works great. Having a PalmOS 5 based machine gives a more powerful web browser that can view more sites. Higher rez screen is nice.On the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it's as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on \"write on screen\" apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.No voice recognition at all, but for $20 you can get a program that is awesome and doesn't have to be trained.  \"Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2\" and it does.  \"Call Bob Tompson Mobile\" and it matches it to the address book -- no training, beyond numbers. VERY NICE.Battery life is so-so.  You have to charge it each day if you use the 'net much. i500 was poor, too, but better than this.  The 6035 I could use for almost a week without charging it!  (6035 and i500 had analog modes, too, while the 650 is digital only.)So, it's okay, I'm okay with it, it crashes/reboots randomly all the time, but ... there's really no other option on Sprint.I would have taken a flip phone over this huge brick phone in a heartbeat...

When a call comes in simply hit answer on the phone and the call comes through the headset. I don't particularly like the comfort fit of the Jabra on my ear so I will probably be looking at other alternatives as well.The camera is now actually good enough to take snapshots you would keep. Almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras.  A few of the critical buttons are placed more intuitively.Initial setup went pretty smoothly, so far, it seamlessly upgraded my old Treo 600 software and imported all my contacts and calendar as well as almost all my applications.  The Sprint phone rep that activated my phone actually seemed to be quite knowledgable.The only real CON is that the Treo 650 Hotsync cable connector is big and clunky compared to 600. IMHO they made a backward step by replacing the sleek original Treo connector with the Tungsten design connector. It requires a separate power supply to charge.  I have been used to charging my Treo 600 through the single USB hotsync cable to my laptop.  This extra power connection is a messy annoyance.  The upside is that since the battery is removable I can have a spare charging elsewhere.Overall opinion is that I wouldn't even consider returning to or buying a Treo 600 now that the Treo 650 is available.</td><td>11 26, 2004</td><td>A245BG7SCVXDJB</td><td>DaveT \"davet\"</td><td>A must get upgrade to the Treo 600!</td><td>1101427200</td></tr><tr><td>B0006FLA80</td><td>List(28, 29)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I am not too picky when it comes to a PDA phone, if I can keep my outlook calendar, appointment, and call the contact store on it, I'm happy!

And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read. Thanks to the faster processor, the program loads a lot faster.However, I am still looking for the built-in WiFi, and the bluetooth does not take voice command; reboot is not as easy as Treo 600. I do not notice the boot up being slow because I rarely have to. However, I did notice that it takes up more internal memory and thus make the available ram less than 10MB the first time I turned it on. (Palm is doing a flash upgrade to fix this, so I heard.) With an SD card, I put a bunch of application on it to get around this until it get fixed. And I was able to have about 18MB available internally.I like this new Treo 650, as to all my handheld gadgets, I bought a fitted case to protect it. If you like me want to keep everything in perfectly nice looking condition, I recommad a case and a screen protector.

At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a \"free return and repair,\" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?

I've always resisted buying a combined device, because I thought \"they aren't ready yet.\"  When it came time to replace my PDA, I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready.  I had concerns about the size of the screen, and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions.  Overall, most of my nervousness about it was groundless.  I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points:Works well as a phone--Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable, even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine.  The interface has been redesigned a bit, and you seldom need the stylus.  Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen, or with the keypad.  You truly can do many functions one-handed.  But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm, you aren't having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile--In English, this means that if your batteries go dead, you don't lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points:Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right.  It's not really a problem, but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms, I'm not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair.  I am able to get two days out of it with medium use, and have a bit of life left in the battery.

My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint's LG-PM325.First, the audio quality was not good.  If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.  Part B, the flash results in a very slight audible clicking, not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence, be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.  Pairing was excellent.  The piece stayed on my head pretty well and comfortably, and making or answering calls was straightforward.I've returned mine because of the two problems.</td><td>07 19, 2005</td><td>AC4H6TDSOSLA3</td><td>gdinero</td><td>Performance Sub-Par</td><td>1121731200</td></tr><tr><td>B0006GFARG</td><td>List(14, 16)</td><td>4.0</td><td>Probably the biggest compliment you can give this headset is that you'll often forget you're using it.  The Scala 500 is incredibly lightweight and (when adjusted properly to your ear) very comfortable.I'm impressed by the controls.  Both the main button and the volume 'wheel' are very accessible and very responsive.  With the Sony HBH35 headset I was constantly dropping calls due to the unresponsive controls.  This never happens with the Scala 500.  Additionally, volume is easily regulated.Pairing with the Motorola MPX220 phone was quick and easy.  Additionally, reconnect is quick and reliable following a disconnect due to powering off one of the units or going out of range.  (Range, by the way, is good; comparable with the HBH35 headset.)You can hear the other party clearly and crisply.  Transmission of your voice, I would say, is good.  Though there's infrequent interferrence (static) on voice transmission, I've never had anyone complain about difficulty in hearing/understanding me.  There's NO annoying \"bluetooth echo.\"To sum it up:Plusses:  Price, size, weight, comfort, pairing, controls, sound quality, range, responsive customer service.Negatives:  Requires charging cradle (one more thing to haul around if you're traveling), no 'fuel guage' to indicate battery life (red flash comes on, but only when it's close to dying)</td><td>04 8, 2005</td><td>A2731AZYMXHG53</td><td>James R.

The product integrates well with everything (My Laptop - sony vaio, cellphone (siemens sx56, my panasonic cordless home phone (although with the panasonic, ppl complain about my voice being faint)).  But the issue is , I hear static crackling noises even if I'm not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter, it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue, as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured, if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset, then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet , it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (1,2,3) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet, the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one, to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.  The manual says, that it is due to interference.  I think many 2.4 Ghz can cause this inteference.  Alhtough I turned off all of my wireles devices, it still caused the issue even in my car (slightly better, but not totally gone).But in any case if you don't hear the crackling, it integrates very well with everything.  The crackling is heard only by you, not by the person on the other side.  So we can probably live with it.  There are not many bluetooth adapters that are available out there.Note: Many reviewers here complain about this adpater not working well with home phones.  First of all, if you read the manual, this is not designed to work with home phones (if it works well with home phones, then you're lucky).

Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very \"floppy\" fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced \"speakerphone\" effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call.

I do my research, ad nauseum, before getting into a new contract or into bed with a new cell provider. I've been a Nextel subscriber for two years with an i90 and an i730. Both lovely phones - service very professional from Nextel - coverage and features what I expected.  But like I said, I researched that to death before I bought their phones or their service.  Got the phones from Amazon.I, too, was taken by the looks of the RAZR, and so was my wife once she saw one.  But was it as good as it looked and was it worth and worth switching carriers for?  For one, Nextel wasn't making it easy to stay with them - they got into bed with Sprint and I had Sprint for years and still have nightmares about their customer service.  (Plus, the price for an \"upgrade phone\" for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view.  Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact!)I got two RAZR's at a local retailer - sorry Amazon, but your rebates with Cingular aren't worth the effort - and paid $99 each, best price *anywhere.*  I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon's and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel.  A *bunch* of money.  Two words: rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone, reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well, if not better, than my i730, which is a *great* phone, and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony, Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have.  I repeat: I read some of the manual, which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book, shame on you.  I was worried about the address book based on reviews, but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone, I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some.  There are so many ways to configure the address book it's silly.  You can assign and create \"categories\"  for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life, the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it, better than half the phones on the market today.  I can say that cos I feel like I've researched about half the phones on the market ... :)  Do this: plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night.  I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone? How clumsy are you?  I've beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it.  Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot, which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times.  I'm happy with the material and it's expected durability.  Stop throwing your delicate, *expensive,* micro-electronic device around like it's made of teflon.  *Be careful.*I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it's nature usually expensive and difficult.  (A good example is the ROKR, the so-called iTunes phone.  I have an iPod, and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod,I would have bought it, but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that isn't the easiest thing to pull off well ...) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink  of an eye.  It's expensive because it's a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious.  Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities, so don't be surprised by that.  Want a good camera phone for Cingular? The Sony s710 got great reveiws; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs.  That's the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it's not working out for me.  So there's a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone.  Still, I did my research so there wouldn't be too many surprises when I got the phone.Hope this helps.</td><td>09 16, 2005</td><td>A3AUR4JFEJNXDY</td><td>anthonyg</td><td>Lovely phone - get what you pay for... !</td><td>1126828800</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(10, 13)</td><td>3.0</td><td>The phone is ok.

Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the \"MORE\" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the \"audio sweet spot\" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? \"Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.\"4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says \"Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet\". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.</td><td>08 27, 2005</td><td>A39KJOCZGCM8P1</td><td>Chris Lee Mullins</td><td>Great looking phone....if yer into that sort of thing</td><td>1125100800</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(26, 27)</td><td>3.0</td><td>The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.

I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.

I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me.  Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away.  The best phone I ever had.  Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos.  Really big disapointment.  Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia.  When this came out I jumped on it.  Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones.PROS:-Some what sturdy case.  The metal parts seem solid. No marks as of yet (1 month).-The battery life is a little tiny bit higher then your average phone.  I have to charge it at night but it has at least half the life left on it.  I talk for about 3 hours a day.-Camera is ok not the best and by far not the worst.-Slim form factor.  And yes its wider then your normal flip but this is a good size.  Other phones always seemed to skinny for me.CONS:-Not all of it is metal.  The bottom is plastic and it seems to be cheap plastic.  It creaks when you push on it.  I think that is where the antenna is, and if it has a SAR rating of .80 (I think) at the ear then I wonder how much your jaw is getting.  Rather my jaw get cancer then my brain right?-The vol is almost a joke it is so low.  At the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting.  I used to have to turn people down on my cell, now I am struggling to hear them sometimes.-The keypad looks nice but its a pain in the butt.  The donut thing in the middle is already scracthed by my finger nail.  The rest of the keypad is protected it seems and has no marks.-A pain to clean.  The keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it.  When you clean it the rubber lining between the keys grabs part of what ever cloth you are using and gets it looking even worse.-Phone book.  Good god man.  The fact that they used this phone book really shows that either they don't put a lot of effort into the phone or was a total mess up.  Either way it is a true shame.-Good luck with support and warranty from Moto.  Past experiences with them was very poor.  You send your phone to get fixed and a month later you get it back and they didn't even read what the problem was before they \"fix\" it and send it back still broken.The reason they make phones out of cheap plastic in my opinion is because what do you do 6 months after your phone looks like you dropped it down the stairs a few dozen times.  You buy another.  Strong durable plastic is used all the time.  For crying out loud Glad uses it all the time.  I am more then happy to pay 600 dollars on quality and if you have the money do the same.  This phone is not even close to meeting my expectations of what I thought I would get for a 600 dollar \"basic\" cell phone.  I have high standards and for top dollar I want the best.  Moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now. 250 or something on Amazon as of now.  Well worth it for that price.To the other reviewer about Verizon.  They use CDMA and this phone is only for GSM.  I doubt they will ever make a CDMA version.  But of course I have no real clue.  Call Motorola.Also sorry for my spelling mistakes and all.  It would take to much time to go back and review what I wrote.  I am not getting paid for this and won't waste my time.

CHECK. Innovative construction... CHECK. Exclusive price tag... CHECK. In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike, the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such. If you're looking for a feature rich phone, then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less. But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams, &#34;look at me, I'm a sexy b*tch,&#34; then the V3 is up your alley.Actually, a better analogy would be: The Acura NSX of mobile phones. Like the NSX, I feel the V3 is a marketing tool for Motorola. It's their way of saying, &#34;We're known for inexpensive phones, but, look, we can build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;Unless wireless technology improves from GSM, the V3 is a phone that I can definitely keep for more than 2 years. The styling, design, and construction is just that good (I upgraded from a trusty and reliable, yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone).There's been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I've heard is that the bottom backside (below the battery cover) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna. It certainly makes perfect sense to me (unless the metal frame IS the antenna) as all the other areas are cold to touch (in this weather) while those areas are usually room temperature. Furthermore, it would be misrepresentation on Motorola's part to advertise it as such. Regardless, this phone may seem flimsy, but it's very solid -- there is no comparison w/ my old Nokia 3360 and my girlfriend's V551.Mikey's likeys:1- The mini-USB port. This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it's simple and should be a mobile phone standard!2- The Bluetooth connectivity. Coming from a wired hands-free setup, my Bluetooth headset (a Jabra BT250) is a godsend. I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room. (SIDE NOTE: stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details)3- Quad band. Doubtful that I'll ever use this feature/benefit, but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone. I've been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones, but I've got to admit, the V3's speaker phone is the bomb. It's loud and clear (but not loud enough for the car). My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup. When I don't have my Bluetooth headset, I'm spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display. Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks, I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display. And not only that, the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator! All other phones (excluding PDA phones) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey's no-likeys:1- No memory expansion. I don't see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory, but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice. Maybe Motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner's manual. I have found that the owner's manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own. It does not explain how to use many common features that owners (especially ones new to Motorola phones) use. Instead, it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together. It's like the &#34;C++ Reference&#34; vs &#34;Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days.&#34; Maybe Motorola's technical writers are just to technical?3- Drops and dings. Like any &#34;Ferrari,&#34; I'll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone. I'm hoping there will be [good] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket. (SIDE NOTE: I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone, but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance)4- No EDGE. My girlfriend's $99 Motorola v551 has EDGE. Shame, shame, shame Motorola. Bad Motorola. Bad, bad, bad. Alas, it's akin to buying a $160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k for an Acura NSX and it's only 290hp).5- Internal display colors. I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors, but Motorola's specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors, but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback. Very, very, sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone. PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers (you don't have to do this if a name only has one number);2- set the address book view to &#34;Primary Contacts&#34; in Phonebook Menu &#62;&#62;&#62; Phonebook Setup &#62;&#62;&#62; View;3- voila, only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia's implementation (refer to my owner's manual dis-like above), but I have found Motorola's implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE: It's been nearly three weeks since I've bought this phone and no buyer's remorse.</td><td>11 21, 2004</td><td>A3JMO0ET6611HV</td><td>M.D. \"mdoan300\"</td><td>The Ferrari of Mobile Phones</td><td>1100995200</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've had this phone for a while now and here's what I think.The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people, and yes, it's not as intuitive as say, Nokia's interface, but it does have some pros.  You can customize every button, including all 4 arrows, and the left and right soft keys.  I have my left soft key programmed to go to \"Shortcuts\" and I have every function I need right there.  And of course, after a while of use, you will get used to the interface.The volume of the phone is decent.  I have no problems hearing other people, and they have no problems hearing me.  Speakerphone works great too.  My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he's talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls.  The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring.  One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this:  If you use your SIM card to store your addresses, then no, you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person.  But if you use your phone's memory to store your numbers, you can have many many numbers stored to each entry.  I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook's address book, so I'm not too worried about having them on my SIM card.  And if you have a MAC, iSync works wonders with syncing numbers/calendars to the RAZR....now THAT'S cool!The screen is very large and clear.  I have no problems seeing it in dark or even bright light.  I have had no problems with reception with Cingular so far.  In fact, I have a stronger signal in most places than my previous phone (Nokia 6230)Overall, I am very pleased with the design, functions, and asthetics of this phone.</td><td>11 16, 2005</td><td>AYW1TGDCP2OK6</td><td>MestaySS</td><td>So far, so great!</td><td>1132099200</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2E1O</td><td>List(3, 5)</td><td>3.0</td><td>Bought this phone(Actually the black v3 but the only real difference is video support and additional memory), for $149 from BB, replacing my v551, basically just for the \"chic factor\". Initally I was very happy and excited with my purchase, but after a couple of weeks the novelty wore off and its shortcomings became apparent. The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece. Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random \"sweet spot' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments. I even removed the little \"M\" circle with little or no help. The second shortcoming is the the screen. While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good. And if you are viewing blacks and not looking directly at it, you get a wierd grey-black thing going on with one eye. Kind of hard to explain, except for those of you with the phone. Much to my dismay the screen is actually WORSE than the one on the v551. The third is the camera. I rarely use a phone cam, but the times I needed it, the pictures looked, well...horrible. And last but not least, the reception. The reception is not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The v551 actually had better reception. My new LG CE500 actually has MUCH better reception and is generally a much better phone. This phone is a GOOD phone.

Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a \"shared plan\" from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your \"Cell phone Numbers\" right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a \"single 700 rollover mins shared plan\" before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to \"My Account\" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular \"in my area\" puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away \"With NO ROAMING charges\" btw our last cell phone service \"Alltel\" would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in \"Speaker Phone\" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call \"Mobile to Mobile\".We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it \"needs\" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the \"address book being slow\" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don't, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by \"Name\" or \"Speed dial #\" or \"Voice name\" or even by \"Email\" and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for \"Voice command\" it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for \"list only\" \"no picture\" and by \"primary number only\", simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in \"Categories\" such as \"Business/Personal/General/VIPs\"Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have \"primary number only\" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to \"Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers\" once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about \"ear piece volume too low\"  the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the \"volume\" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the \"top edge of the phone\", too low and volume will sound low. Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose \"PHONE\" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under \"sunlight\" is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE: 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones, neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use (these are our only phones, we only have cell phone service no land line).The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them.</td><td>10 7, 2005</td><td>AVK9BSXJJ51I8</td><td>S.

The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively.  My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement.  It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner.  I was concerned about the thickness and durability.  This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone.My old accessories don't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do?I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3.0 by Avanquest for my previous phone.  I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4.0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone.  With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I don't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip.  I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone's memory and I use it as my wallpaper.My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola.  On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning.  I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying.The Razr and my Jabra work well together.  It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes.So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone.</td><td>10 30, 2006</td><td>ANF5BP1SD3Z3O</td><td>Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01</td><td>Razr V3 works great for me.</td><td>1162166400</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2G3U</td><td>List(9, 11)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I had a Samsung X427 before this and it was awful.

I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can't believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3's to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don't waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks.</td><td>09 5, 2005</td><td>A35IX2GE0VC0JP</td><td>FirePepper Red \"firepepper red\"</td><td>Excellent Phone</td><td>1125878400</td></tr><tr><td>B0006I2G3U</td><td>List(17, 18)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've had this phone for about four months now, and I haven't had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces.  I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone.</td><td>04 26, 2005</td><td>A2ZZGWC4FUGJAE</td><td>M.

The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling.

This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it.  Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum).  From the many online reviews I've read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls.  I haven't seen many of those types of comments lately so I'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros--Very good reception and sound quality.  Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It's nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly).  Nice raised number keys.--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ringtones; also extensive selection of built in ringtones (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals).--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn't with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn't actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it's fine.  You can store five numbers and an email per entry. (You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing).  It's not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works.--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto's recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it's fine.  Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use.  (As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically.)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60.  But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds.  You have to touch a key to make it come back on.  This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user's manual doesn't explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that's the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky.  As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds).--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user's manual--Lousy user's manual--Did I mention the lousy user's manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal.  In other words, it \"learns\" one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase.--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off: I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC)--I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal.--The synchronization software (Motorola Mobile Phone Tools)and cable cost extra.  I have not been able to make it function.  Motorola's support is utterly worthless--I asked for help online and they told me to call them.  Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person.  The software developer--BVRP--is trying to help but hasn't been able to fix the problem.  I may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software.</td><td>05 27, 2005</td><td>A3LSLLR3OAJI7Y</td><td>Steven Metz</td><td>I'm Very Pleased</td><td>1117152000</td></tr><tr><td>B0006J419Q</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>4.0</td><td>I didn't like it but my husband seems to think that it works great for him and uses it often.</td><td>01 8, 2013</td><td>A38X2R3BOQGQZQ</td><td>B.

This headset fits and works perfectly.If you are familiar with the mono headset that shipped with older Palm or Handspring Treo phones, this headset is a stereo version. The buds are hard plastic in-the-ear type with a thin cushion (which you must install without tearing). The microphone is on the left bud, and is held close to your mouth because the left side wire is much shorter than the right side. The mic has an answer/hang up button. And the set is terminated by a 3/32\" four conductor plug.The build and sound quality of this set are good. The plug has strain relief and the wiring is thin but more rugged than expected.  The buds have bass ports and the mic capsule is a reasonable size. The Centro has a microSD card for storing MP3 tracks, and this headset does a good job reproducing the dynamic range of classical music.There are better headsets available. But if you want a headset to fit a stereo Treo with a mic, answer button, and decent sound, it's hard to find one that costs less.

Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don't understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won't have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it, it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn't take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter, but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere.</td><td>04 9, 2006</td><td>A35IX2GE0VC0JP</td><td>FirePepper Red \"firepepper red\"</td><td>Good  headset but has its flaws</td><td>1144540800</td></tr><tr><td>B0007IOMOU</td><td>List(6, 6)</td><td>4.0</td><td>The battery life on this unit is great.

It's not the best.

This is no a problem, it holds well, but a magnet might have been nice.The only real drawbacks are that when you keep the cover closed for a while, it may leave small horizontal smudge marks on the phone from the card pockets. Also extended use of the phone in this case will cause it to heat up faster than on some of the other cases I've tried.

I decided to use the BoxWave exclusively and have not been dissatisified with my decision.  I simply slide the Note 2 into my front pocket.  And no, the phone isn't too big for my pants pocket.The pros for this case is that it makes the Note 2 look stylish, and due to the rubbery feel, it makes the phone feel quite stable in my hand; however, the rubbery feel doesn't interfere with it going in and out of my pocket.  If I had to come up with a con for the BoxWave Tuxedo Suitup case, it would be that due to its glossiness, it shows fingerprints,  However, they wipe off easily.In summary, I would definitely order one of these cases again.</td><td>01 2, 2013</td><td>A1KXM1DAQUE89H</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Great case</td><td>1357084800</td></tr><tr><td>B0007MAOOS</td><td>List(1, 1)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I received this item in Dec.

There's a huge difference, in case you, the reader, doesn't know.  TPU is better... LIGHT YEARS better!But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there; and not because there's anything wrong with the TPU. Rather, it's because they're cheaply made, or not cut precisely accurately... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut.  It's perfect.  Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath... the camera lens, the flash, the speaker, the mic holes, the earphone jack, and, of course, the stylus.  Note that there's no holes for the power button or volume rocker......and that, TRUST ME, is the way it SHOULD be!  So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers, and that's a huge mistake.  If you've ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know, the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you've ever open one of those up and cleaned one, then you've seen the dark kinda' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot.  That stuff is body oil, mixed with skin cells, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with lint from the mouse pad, mixed with godknows what else.  It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch......including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone!  And when that stuff gets in there, buttons stick, and phones either won't turn on or off, or can't have their screens awakened properly... or, one of the common ones which people often don't realize is caused by a sticking power button:  boot loops!Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem.  Of course, there's still the electromechanical HOME key that's uncovered; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken, because their HOME keys cause weird behavior; but, in fact, all that's wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with... well... you get the picture.There's not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem (if it's a hardware electromechanical one, as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass), but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them......and this one does... and magnificently.  It even has nicely-molded buttons (as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it.  This case is simply molded beautifully!This case is special for another reason, too, which many people, I'll bet, don't know about, and that's precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone: the bezel around the glass screen.  It's really nice, and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda' unique in that the very, very edges of its glass screen  aren't like almost any other phone.  Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens; and then there's the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass's edge all-'round; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen, so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table, the glass, itself, it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table's surface.Well, the Note II's glass is actually higher up (when it's lying on its back) than the bezel edge of the case; and, in fact, the very, very edge of the Note II's glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case's bezel. As such, if you lay the Note II on its face (on its glass, it's the glass that actually touches the table.  This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors; and one maker of them (REALOOK) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II: one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II's screen, and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge; and then they make another (the REALOOK \"3D\" screen protector for the Note II) that's molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and \"hang\" down over it, so to speak, to make the protector's edge come closer to the case's bezel, and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases, the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel, that's fine.  The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass.  But with the  REALOOK \"3D\" style screen protector that wraps over the edge, that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass, so that if the phone is laid on its face (on its glass sreen), the glass doesn't touch because it's being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk.  But it gets better:  That edge \"respects\" the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and doesn't try to wrap up over onto and cover it.  Therefore, the REALOOK 3D screen protector's edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case... different from most others... and the only kind you can have, actually, if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to, or over the edge of, the Note II's glass.Seriously, this thing is PRECISION... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II... and got it PERFECT!The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it wouldn't show such fingerprints.  The TPU cases out there that are called \"s-style\" or \"s-series\" TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the \"s\" shape on the case's back, and a shiny finish (like this case has everywhere) on the other side of the \"s\" shape on the case's back.  The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that's on those \"s\" cases, in my opinion; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly, those \"s\" series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass, and on the Note II, that doesn't work well with most screen protectors. Plus, many of those \"s\" style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons. Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp; and so for me, at least, it's worth it to just endure its shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.Great case!  Best-of-breed, at least among cases that don't cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up.  If one is not using a \"3D\" type of screen protector from REALOOK, though; if one is using REALOOK's other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II's screen, then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine (as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons); but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one. Seriously, this one is made very, very well... very precise. I just love it!Gregg L.

This is the same case but with a uniform glossy texture.  I had a Boxwave case for my Note I and it was great.  This new case is even better.  It is thinner and more streamlined, and the buttons work even better.  This doesn't have cutouts for the buttons, instead it has well-designed buttons of its own molded into the case that push on the phone's buttons.  I like this because the buttons work just as well but they are protected at the same time from crud/damage.  Cutouts for the ports/mics/camera/stylus are placed perfectly and sized appropriately. Lastly, this case is made from TPU, which is the best case material in my opinion.  It's firmer so it stays on the phone better than the soft silicone cases and does not pick up lint or stick to your pocket, while still offering some cushion when you drop it.</td><td>12 13, 2012</td><td>A2E9SRCRO6XLJI</td><td>Kevin</td><td>very nice</td><td>1355356800</td></tr><tr><td>B0007MAOOS</td><td>List(4, 4)</td><td>2.0</td><td>I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone. However it did interfere with my cellular signal and brought my bars down from 3 to 1 and sometimes none. I started dropping calls and the people on the other line said I was fading in and out when I was able to talk to someone. I took the cover off my Note 2 and my bars popped back up to 3 and I had no problems with phone calls anymore. I tried it again to make sure it was the cover, and sure enough it did the same thing as before. I had my partner try it as he has the same kind of phone and it did the same thing to his Note 2. So I had to return the case for a refund. It is disappointing because it was a great looking case.</td><td>06 5, 2013</td><td>A5BXA4BQOK0S2</td><td>Kristopher D.
